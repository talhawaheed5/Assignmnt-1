Continuous integration 
  Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors 
  into a single software project. It's a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes 
  into a central repository where builds and tests then run.
Continuous delivery
    Continuous delivery is a software development practice that uses automation to speed the release of new code.
    It establishes a process through which a developerâ€™s changes to an application can be pushed to a code repository 
    or container registry through automation.
